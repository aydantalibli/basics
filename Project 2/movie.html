  <h2>My Top 5 Fav Movies</h2> 
  <p>1. A Prophet (2009) Jacques Audiard’s arthouse prison drama draws on French, Italian, Arab and Hollywood cinema for the perfect European cocktail of style, crime and immigrant ambition. Playing many parts, Tahar Rahim’s young Muslim inmate Malik survives, murders and mutates under the power of Corsican mob boss Cesar (an unforgettable Niels Arestrup).</p> 
  <p>2. The Great Beauty (2013) The decadent, faded “dolce vita” of old Europe is exquisitely, lasciviously captured by Paolo Sorrentino’s film and chronicled by Roman journalist Jep Gambardella (the creation of actor Toni Servillo) who clings to his privileged existence to search for meaning in a whirl of guilt, religion, sex, art and irony.</p>
  <p>3. A Bout de Souffle (1959) The game-changer. Cinema was never the same after Jean Luc Godard’s New Wave study in style hit the Paris streets, a low budget experiment that became an enduring touchstone. Jean-Paul Belmondo is the hood on the lam (breathless from running, or from smoking?), Jean Seberg sells the Herald-Tribune on the Champs Elysees. From jump cuts to haircuts, it’s possibly the most influential film ever.</p>
  <p>4 Faces Places (2017) A delightful, invigorating documentary from Agnes Varda who, at 88, kept that nouvelle vague spirit alive but lent it the humanist heart and twinkling, mischievous charm that personified the works of this unique film-maker. Collaborating with hipster photographer JR, she documents working lives in dwindling communities in an age of globalisation, stamping whole villages with identity, belonging and pride.</p>
  <p>5 Cabaret (1972) Wilkommen, bienvenue, welcome – Bob Fosse’s masterpiece of a musical (based on Christopher Isherwood’s stories of Berlin life) nailed a unique European atmosphere and zeitgeist with its satirically louche scenes in the Kit Kat Club presaging the rise of Nazism outside: Money Makes the World Go Round is as chilling as Tomorrow Belongs To Me.</p>
